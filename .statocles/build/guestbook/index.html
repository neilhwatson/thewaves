         Thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful cottage. It was so easy
         to make ourselves at home. Even our rescue doe, Lexi, found it so
         relaxing here and we found out she loves the water. We hope to return
         again next year. I made you a little sign for your cottage with wood I
         found on the rocks. I hope you like it.

         bathrooms, two indoor fireplaces, and just ten minutes to town.

         My daughters and I spent a wonderful weekend at the beach house for a girls
         weekend- it is more beautiful than the website pictures show - amazing views,
         spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated with a calm restive theme, a large
         kitchen where we prepared dinners together, and a lovely gas fireplace to take
         the chill away in the evening. The trails in Presqu&#39;ile Provincial park just a
         couple of kms away helped us work up a healthy appetite and enjoy a cool drink
         back at the beach house along the shore. The waves lulled us to sleep at night
         in very comfortable beds.  My daughters plan on going back with friends and we
         will definitely return for another girls weekend. A beautiful place for a
         getaway!

         We spent a wonderful few days at The Waves Beach House. The cottage is
         in a convenient location close to town but far away enough from all the
         hustle and bustle. The access to a private beach in the backyard made
         relaxing by the water a dream. The cottage fits the description
         provided, had all the basic necessities needed and was beautifully
         decorated and cozy to make our stay perfect. We will definitely come
         back!

         beautiful view of the water and plenty of sunlight. I would
         highly recommend it to anyone seeking a reprieve from their

         cottage is very inviting and clean. We had everything we needed for the
         night. We hope to be back to enjoy it again this summer. Highly
